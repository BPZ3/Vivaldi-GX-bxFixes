## How to inspect the UI
- Open `vivaldi://inspect/#apps`<br>
There should be listed every Vivaldi window you have open, with its tabs, in a "tree style" view.
- Look for the window you want to use as test subject (Vivaldi windows are named `Vivaldi` with its url being `chrome-extension://<something>/browser.html`).
- Hit `Inspect` under "Vivaldi"<br>
This will open the Dev tools, inspecting the UI
