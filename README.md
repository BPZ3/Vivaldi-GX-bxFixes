Go in `vivaldi://experiments` and check `Allow for using CSS modifications`
2. **Download the mod**</br>
In this page, click on `Code` and select `Download ZIP`<br>
Or you can go in the releases page, and download a specific version's `Source code (zip)`
3. **Install**</br>
  1. Extract the `Mod` folder to anywhere safe on your PC
  2. Open Vivaldi Settings > Apperance and in "Interface Modifications", select that `Mod` folder

## How to inspect the UI
- Open `vivaldi://inspect/#apps`<br>
There should be listed every Vivaldi window you have open, with its tabs, in a "tree style" view.
- Look for the window you want to use as test subject (Vivaldi windows are named `Vivaldi` with its url being `chrome-extension://<something>/browser.html`).
- Hit `Inspect` under "Vivaldi"<br>
This will open the Dev tools, inspecting the UI
