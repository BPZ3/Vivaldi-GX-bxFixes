About the two .css files, the standard one will "connect" the tab line to sidebar and status bar, but it
looks awful if you hide the sidebar.
The other one, I left it all "unconnected", ideally if you usually hide the sidebar.
After choosing one of them, you must save it with the name "style.css"

Disclaimer: There may be some browser settings that do not work well with this modification, such as:
- Page loading bar in address bar
So I recommend that you disable these settings, and use the browser with the most "default" layout possible.

Colors for theme:
> Background: #090411
> Foreground: #fafafa
> Highlight (In this one you are free to choose the color you want,
   but the color used in the previews is): #fa1e4e
> Accent: #14111a

Theme settings:
> Accent color from active page: by default, I leave it unchecked, but you can turn it on (it won't colorize
the tab lines).
> Apply accent color to window: unchecked
> Transparent Tabs: checked.
> Corner rounding: 5px
