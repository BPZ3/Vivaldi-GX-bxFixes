There may be settings that do not work well with this modification, such as:
- Page loading bar in address bar
So I recommend that you disable these settings, and use the browser with the most "default" layout possible.

Colors for theme:
Background: #090411
Foreground: #fafafa
Highlight (In this one you are free to choose the color you want, but the color used in the previews is): #fa1e4e
Accent: #14111a
